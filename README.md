Currency Converter
This is a simple currency converter application built using Python and the tkinter library. The application allows users to select a from and to currency, enter an amount, and convert the amount from one currency to another.

Getting Started
To run the application, you need to install Python and the tkinter library. Once you have installed these dependencies, simply run the code in a Python interpreter or IDE.

Usage
The application provides two dropdown menus for selecting the from and to currencies, an entry field for entering the amount to convert, a label for displaying the converted amount, and two buttons for converting and resetting the input fields.

To convert the amount, select the from and to currencies, enter the amount, and click on the "Convert" button. The application uses the Open Exchange Rates API to retrieve the exchange rate and convert the amount.

To reset the input fields, click on the "Reset" button.
